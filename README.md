# case-study-ml-consulting

## Description:
Repository for interview use case study. This project involves analysing the Student Performance Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to predict student performance.

## Dataset used:
[Student Performance Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Key tasks include:
- Data Understanding and Preprocessing: Exploratory data analysis and preparation for modeling.
- Modeling: Implementation of atwo machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest) to predict student grades, with performance evaluated using appropriate metrics.
- Feature Importance and Insights: Interpretation of model results, feature importance analysis, and visualization.
- Recommendations: Data-driven suggestions for educators to enhance student performance based on the analysis.
- Deliverables include documented code, visualizations, insights, and a concise presentation summarizing findings and recommendations.
